# Steps:
# 1. Install dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download ResNet18 weights:
#    - Manually download resnet18-f37072fd.pth from PyTorch's model zoo:
#      https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth
#    - Place it in the Downloads folder (no need to move it elsewhere).

# 3. Replace folder paths:
#    - Update `project_root` to your dataset folder path.
#    - Update `weights_path` to: "/Users/your_username/Downloads/resnet18-f37072fd.pth"
